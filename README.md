# C-FOR-BEGINNERS

# INTRODUCTION OF C
* C LANGUAGE IS THE FUNCTIONAL ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE...
* ONE BUG PROBLEN IS DIVIDED IN TO MODULES EACH MODULE IS HAVING HEADER H FILES AND C FILES,WE CAN SPECIFY THE FUNCTION PROTOTYPES,AND CONSTANTS WE CAN DEFINE FUNCTION THAT ARE   MORE USED IN OTHER MODULES OR SOME MODULE...
* PROGRAMMING IS NOTHING BUT HANDLING THE DATA IF THE FUNCTION THERE ARE MUCH LIMITATION OR POSSIBILITES TO MISS HANDLE DATA I.e GLOBAL VARIABLES..
* IN LOOP THE PERCEPTION OF TWO COMPLEX PROBLEM IS NEAR TO THE HUMAN PERCEPTION OF THE COMPLEX PROBLEM..
# STATEMENT SEPARATION
* STATEMENT IN THE C LANGUAGE ARE SEPARATED BY ;
# POPULAR FEATURES OF C LANGUAGE
* APART FROM THE FACT, THE C LANGUAGE IS GIVEN A HEADSTART DUE TO ITS CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH POPULAR OS UNIX
# COMPILER 
* A "C" IS PROGRAMME CANNOT BE RUN DIRECTLY BY A COMPUTER.THIS IS BECAUSE A COMPUTER CAN UNDERSTAND AND EXCUTE ONLY THOSE PROGRAMS THT ARE WRITTEN IN MISSION LANGUAGE
* A 'C' COMPILE IS A SOFTWARE THAT TRANSULATE INTO A MISSION LANGUAGE PROGRAME...
* STRUCTURE OF THE C PROGRAME
=> DEFINE ALL HEADER FILES 
-> DEFINE ALL GOOD VARIABLES
=> MAIN FUNCTION SHOULD BE THERE
# PROGRAMMING STEPS :-
#include<stdioo.h>
main(){
printf("welcome to c world");
printf("rushik");
return o;
}
# key in a c programming
* int
* else
* if
* continue
* flote
* and many more we will discuss later in this topic
# programme unsigned
 #include<stdio.h>
 #include<conio.h>
 int main(){
 unsigned int n;
 clrscr();
 printf("enter number");
 scanf("%u",&n);
 printf("the number is :%u",n);
 return 0
 }
 # programe :-
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main(){
 floate rd;
printf("enter the decimal number");
scanf("%f",&rd);
printf("decimal number is %f\n,rd");
printf("removing tailing zeros :%g\n",rd); 
return 0
}
# programe =>(give n value)
 #include<stdio.h>
 #include<conio.h>
 int main(){
 int sum,n;
 printf("enter n value \n");
 scanf("%d",&n);
 sum=n*(n+1)/2;
 printf("the sum of first %d numbers is %d",n,sum);
 return 0
 }
